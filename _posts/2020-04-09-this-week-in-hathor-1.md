# This Week in Hathor 1

Hello and welcome to the first issue of This Week in Hathor! Hathor is a new architecture for tokenization, radically
simple.  This is a weekly summary of its progress and community. Want something mentioned? [Send us a pull
request](https://github.com/HathorNetwork/this-week-in-hathor). Want to get involved? We love contributions.

This Week in Hathor is openly developed [on GitHub](https://github.com/HathorNetwork/this-week-in-hathor). If you find
any errors in this week's issue, [please submit a PR](https://github.com/HathorNetwork/this-week-in-hathor). This Week
in Hathor is inspired by [This Week in Rust](https://this-week-in-rust.org/), if you have any suggestions on how we
